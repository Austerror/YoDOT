@classname 
	AI.DeclarativeTalk
@description 
	This class provides a topic stack based conversation handling and wrappers some common Npc-to-player conversation functions. 
There are two ways to use this class, first, every condition/action function in a AI.DeclarativeTalk gets a talk object(the same if talking to the same player) when its called. The propose of this is to ease the writing of declarative code, the talk object can be used to access common functions, like Say(), or Listen(). Other functions from this class (like Ask, AskAgreement, Response, BadResponse) are intended to be used away from AI.DeclarativeTalk, because they make use of a topic stack, unexpected behavior might occur if you mix declarative code with stack based code.
The second way to use this class, the imperative mode as I like to call it is to make use of callback functions for hear events, building the stack of topics inside them. It’s pretty easy actually:
[code]
	MyNpc.GreetReply = function(talk)
		talk:Say(“Yo son, this is your first Npc”)
		talk:AskAgreemnt(“Do you like me?”,
			function()
				talk:Say(“I know you’d to love me!”)
			end,
			function()
				talk:Say(“):”)
			end)
	end
[/code]
While this code might look harsh or difficult, you can cleanup things by creating separated functions:
[code]
	local function heLikesMe(talk)
		talk:Say(“I know you’d to love me!”)
	end
	local function heDontLikesMe(talk)
		talk:Say(“):”)
	end
	MyNpc.GreetReply = function(talk)
		talk:Say(“Yo son, this is your first Npc”)
		talk:AskAgreemnt(“Do you like me?”, heLikesMe, heDontLikesMe)
	end
[/code]
It might look tedious to create two separate functions for just replying text! You have 2 choices try with AI.DeclarativeTalk or make use of the convenient reply classes:
[code]
	MyNpc.GreetReply = function(talk)
		talk:Say(“Yo son, this is your first Npc”)
		talk:AskAgreemnt(“Do you like me?”, talk:ReplySay(“I know you’d to love me!”),  talk:ReplySay(“):”))
	end
[/code]
The way AI.Talk handles the topics has to be examined carefully. First, a topic is a question or a statement awaiting a response, the topics doesn’t have an ID or some sort of name, they just exists, like in normal conversations. When you ask something using the functions Ask and AskAgreement, a new topic is pushed into the stack, when a player says something, the topic on the top of the stack (that is, the last we pushed into the stack) is retrieved and matched. If the player said something valid (in the above case “Yes” or “Affirmative”) the topic ‘good response’ its executed (in the above case, the ‘heLikesMe’ function), otherwise (‘No’, ‘Negative’) the topic ‘bad response’ its executed.
Lets say we want to ask a player what vocation he would like to become, we might code something like this:
[code]
	talk:Ask(“Do you want to become a {Sorcerer}, {Druid}, {Paladin} or {Knight}?”)	
[/code]
The enclosed {} strings are used by Ask as ‘good responses’, so if the player answer any of those, a ‘good response’ function will be called(if any), if a player says anything else, the bad response will be called (if any).
[code]
talk:Ask(“Do you want to become a {Sorcerer}, {Druid}, {Paladin} or {Knight}?”)	
talk:Response(function(talk, vocation) 
	talk:AskAgreement(“So you want to become a “ .. vocation .. “eh? Are you sure about this?”, 
	function() -- Yes
	
	end,
	
	function -- No

	end)
end)
[/code]
Immediately after calling AI.Talk.Ask, you can call AI.Talk.Response, this will effectively add the function you pass to Response as a ‘good response’ callback. You can have any amounts of good and bad responses you want. There’s an equivalent AI.Talk.BadResponse, for filling the ‘bad responses’ callbacks.
Now we can examine better the ‘topic’ meaning, we currently have two topics on the stack, the vocation question is our first topic, the agreement question, our second one. When a player says something again, the top topic (the last topic) is pulled from the stack (is not delated thought, just used) and appropriate function responses are called. So, why do we keep the topics on the stack anyway? At any point, the player might want to change his vocation choice, and our oracle will look stupid if we start all over again (assuming we started with “ARE YOU READY!?”), in this case, we simply “go up” into our topic stack (technically the correct thing to say Is “go down in the stack” but it’s the same thing). AI.Talk.GoUp is the function that allow us to do such thing.
Now we can appropriately handle the “No , I want to change my voc” response:
[code]
talk:Ask(“Do you want to become a {Sorcerer}, {Druid}, {Paladin} or {Knight}?”)	
talk:Response(function(talk, vocation) 
	talk:AskAgreement(“So you want to become a “ .. vocation .. “eh? Are you sure about this?”, 
	function() -- Yes
	
	end,
	
	function -- No
		talk:Say(“Then, what vocation do you want to become?”)
		talk:GoUp(1) – Go to the first question WITHOUT REPEATING THE QUESTION
	end)
end)
 [/code]
Awesome, now our oracle looks smart. A similar thing happens when a player says something that doesn’t match anything in the current topic(i.e. there’s no good response match and we don’t have a bad response callback), AI.Talk will go up a max of AI.SocialNpc.GoUpTimes, trying to find an appropriate handler for what the player says. If no one is found, the player is ignored and the topic stack remains the same (unlike GoUp, this normal ‘topic finding’ procedure will not erase the topics on the stack). If the player is ignored for enough time, he might get kicked as the npc is getting bored (see AI.SocialNpc.TalkTimeout). Then player timeout isn’t refreshed when the npc says something to the player, Talk classes (like AI.Talk and AI.DeclarativeTalk) take care of refreshing the timeout. In the case of AI.Talk the talk is refreshed whenever you add new topics in any of the callback functions (i.e asking another thing like in our example), when you call AI.Talk.GoUp inside any of the callback functions and finally if you return true from any  the callback functions.
By making use of closures (http://www.lua.org/pil/6.1.html) we can keep answers from previous question in the local scope:
[code]
talk:Ask(“Do you want to become a {Sorcerer}, {Druid}, {Paladin} or {Knight}?”)	
talk:Response(function(talk, vocation) 
	talk:AskAgreement(“So you want to become a “ .. vocation .. “eh? Are you sure about this?”, 
	function() -- Yes
	end,
	
	function -- No
		talk:Say(“You don’t want to be a “ .. vocation .. “, what vocation do you want to become then?”)
		talk:GoUp(1) 
	end)
end)
 [/code]
But this is not possible if you use functions declared elsewhere like in our second example:
[code]
talk:AskAgreemnt(“Do you like me?”, heLikesMe, heDontLikesMe)
[/code]
This will have a very intuitive solution in a upcoming version, but for now you can make use of the AI.Talk.Var function to store/retrieve data inside the talk object.
If you want to end a conversation at any point, you can use talk:End(msg), if you want to stop the code in a specific point until a player says something again, use talk:Listen(), it’s a very good function but ill cover it on a upcoming review.
